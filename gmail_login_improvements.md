# Gmail Login Robustness Improvements

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Replaced Fixed `time.sleep` with Explicit Waits
- **Email Input**: Now uses `wait_for_element()` with timeout from config (90s) instead of fixed delays
- **Password Page**: Added new method `wait_for_password_page()` that waits for password page URL to load:
  - Checks if URL starts with `https://accounts.google.com/signin/v2/challenge/pwd`
  - Also checks for "challenge/pwd" in URL or absence of "identifier" in URL
  - Uses configurable timeout (90s)

### 2. Extended Global Login Timeout
- Changed default `login_timeout` from 60 to 90 seconds in:
  - `src/config_manager.py` (default config)
  - `config.json` (existing config file)

### 3. Added Retry Logic with 3 Attempts
- Modified `login_to_gmail()` method to retry up to 3 times (configurable via `max_login_attempts`)
- On `TimeoutException`, the system:
  - Reloads the login page (`https://accounts.google.com/signin`)
  - Retries the entire login process
  - Shows progress messages like "retrying... (attempt 2/3)"
- Retry logic covers:
  - Navigation failures
  - Email entry failures
  - Password page loading failures
  - Password entry failures
  - Login verification failures

### 4. Added 2-Step Verification Detection
- Created new method `detect_two_step_verification()` that detects 2FA pages by:
  - Checking for various 2FA input selectors (code inputs, verification fields)
  - Checking URL patterns for 2FA challenges
  - Returns early with clear message: "2-step verification detected for {account}. Skipping this account."
- Detection happens at two points:
  - After password page loads (before entering password)
  - After password submission
- Accounts with 2FA are automatically skipped to allow automation to continue

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Methods Modified:
1. **`login_to_gmail()`**: Complete rewrite with retry loop and 2FA detection
2. **`enter_email()`**: Updated timeouts to use config value (90s)
3. **`enter_password()`**: Updated timeouts to use config value (90s)

### New Methods Added:
1. **`wait_for_password_page()`**: Explicit wait for password page URL
2. **`detect_two_step_verification()`**: Detects 2FA pages and inputs

### Configuration Changes:
- `gmail_settings.login_timeout`: 60 â†’ 90 seconds
- `gmail_settings.max_login_attempts`: Already set to 3 (used for retry logic)

## Benefits
1. **More Reliable**: Explicit waits are more reliable than fixed sleeps
2. **Faster**: Only waits as long as necessary, not fixed durations
3. **Resilient**: Automatic retry on timeouts handles temporary issues
4. **Clear Feedback**: Shows which attempt is being made and why failures occur
5. **2FA Handling**: Automatically skips accounts with 2FA instead of hanging
6. **Configurable**: All timeouts and retry counts are configurable
