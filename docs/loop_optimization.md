# Optimized Playback Looping Logic

## Overview

The YouTube automation system now includes an optimized playback looping mechanism that guarantees infinite video looping, even if the YouTube UI loop feature fails or becomes disabled.

## Implementation Details

### 1. JavaScript Injection Method

The system injects JavaScript code directly into the page after the video loads:

```javascript
const v = document.querySelector('video');
if (v) {
    v.loop = true;
    v.addEventListener('ended', () => {
        console.log('[YouTube Automation] Video ended, restarting...');
        v.play();
    });
}
```

### 2. Dual-Layer Loop Protection

The system implements two layers of loop protection:

1. **YouTube's Native Loop**: Enabled via right-click context menu
2. **JavaScript Loop Injection**: Direct manipulation of the HTML5 video element

### 3. Features

- **Guaranteed Looping**: Even if YouTube's UI loop fails, the video will continue looping
- **Event-Based Restart**: Uses the 'ended' event listener to immediately restart playback
- **Loop Property Setting**: Sets the HTML5 video element's `loop` property to `true`
- **Periodic Verification**: Re-checks and re-injects JavaScript every 5 minutes if needed

### 4. Benefits

- **Reliability**: Eliminates dependency on YouTube's UI, which can change or fail
- **Performance**: Direct JavaScript execution is faster than UI interactions
- **Resilience**: Survives minor page updates without breaking
- **Debugging**: Console logs provide visibility into loop status

## Usage

The JavaScript injection is automatically applied when running the automation:

```python
python main.py --emails accounts.txt --video https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
```

## Testing

Test the loop injection independently:

```bash
python test_loop_injection.py
```

This will:
1. Open a browser with a test video
2. Inject the JavaScript loop code
3. Verify the loop property is set
4. Keep the browser open for manual verification

## Technical Notes

- The injection happens 2 seconds after the video player loads to ensure the video element is ready
- The code is compatible with YouTube's current HTML5 player structure
- Console logging helps with debugging and monitoring
- The periodic check (every 5 minutes) ensures long-term reliability

## Troubleshooting

If looping fails:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify the video element selector is still valid
3. Ensure JavaScript execution is not blocked
4. Check if YouTube has updated their player structure
